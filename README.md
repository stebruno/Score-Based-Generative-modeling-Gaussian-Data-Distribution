# Score-Based-Generative-modeling-Gaussian-Data-Distribution
This is an implementation for Section 3.1 of the paper "On diffusion-based generative models and their error
bounds: The log-concave case with full convergence
estimates" available on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13584. Using score-based generative models, we are able to generate
new data from an approximate distribution that is close to a multivariate Gaussian
distribution with unknown mean and identity covariance.
